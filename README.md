## Inspiration
There are only 250 certified sign language interpreters in India, translating for a deaf population of between 1.8 million and 7 million.

We need to devise a solution that allows inclusion of the deaf and mute people in normal conversations. Our application allows any user to point the camera towards a mute person (with consent, ofcourse) and effectively understand what he/she's trying to say.

### American Sign Language (ASL)
American Sign Language (ASL) is a visual language. With signing, the brain processes linguistic information through the eyes. The shape, placement, and movement of the hands, as well as facial expressions and body movements, all play important parts in conveying information.


## Dataset used
Sign Language MNIST (https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)

## Working
Autocompletion and Word Suggestion simplify and accelerate the process of information transmission. The user can select one out of the top 4 suggestions or keep making more gestures until the desired word is obtained. 


## Use Cases
1. Deaf people can interact with normal people without hesitation
